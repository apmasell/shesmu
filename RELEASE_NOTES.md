# Unreleased

# [1.4.6] - 2020-10-30T10:37+00:00

Changes:

* Add tag regex action filter to Swagger
* Fix regex tag matching in query pretty printer (fixes advanced search)

UI Changes:

* Change popup menu calculation again

# [1.4.5] - 2020-10-29T11:22+00:00

Changes:

* Add a new regular expression filter for action tags
* Fix cast class error with join temporary

UI Changes:

* Display parse errors for advanced search
* Improve advanced search UI feedback
	This changes the advanced search input box to provide a visual indicator of
	the query's status and some indication that _Enter_ should be pressed to
  update.
* Fix popup menu positioning again
* Fix display of time ranges in basic search
* Fix formatting of stats ranges
* Fix month selector for time ranges
* Refresh searches from server on _Actions_ page
	The searches provided by the server are populated at page load time. Since
	searches can be updated based on changes in JIRA, this changes the _Actions_
  page to reload the searches every 15 minutes.
* Add a button to download SVG diagrams (on both the _Olives_ page and the simulator)
* Move counts down in metro diagrams
  The counts in the metro diagrams are the number of output records and this can
  be difficult to recognise. This shifts all the counts down by a half row so
  that the count is between the clause that produced and the clause that consumed
  it.
 
Simulator Changes:

* Improve extra definitions buttons (make the styling consistent and add a download button)
* Improve type parsing and WDL outputs (this allows `wdl_outputs) to be imported correctly)
* Allow sharing a script from the simulation console

Niassa Plugin Changes:

* Pull more job status information from Cromwell (failure information mostly)

SFTP Plugin Changes:

* Improve the SFTP refiller
  This makes a few improvements to the SFTP refiller:
  
  - perform reading stdout and stderr and writing to stdin in separate threads to
    avoid buffering
  - when reading the first line from the child, it checks that it is `OK` or
    `UPDATING` and complain about it
  - kill processes that don't respond appropriately

# [1.4.4] - 2020-10-19T10:44+00:00

Changes:

* Alerts from `Reject` or `Require` clauses now report the line number of the olive rather than the clause.
* Data flow counts for `Export Define` olives are reported better in  Prometheus.
* Clear counts for `.actnow` files when deleted

Language changes:

* Improve type safety of algebraic types comparisons

UI changes:

* Create a new definitions dashboard

* Add groups to _Add Filter_ dialog for actions and alerts
* Put buttons and menus of commands in alphabetical order

  simulator and the saved searches on the _Actions_ page.
* Fix bug where repeat count was negative (on browser console)
* Fix table menu used on the _Olives_ page causing it to look like it should be
  filtered even though it isn't.
* Improve combination locks for dangerous commands
* Synchronize settings across tabs
* Fix a problem where pop up menus will appear in strange locations on the
  page.
* In advanced search, this attempts to refresh the contents as you type, which
  overwhelms the backend causing the front end to behave poorly. This waits
  until enter is pressed.
* Add missing icons to _Bulk Commands_ menu

* Create a `std::string::truncate` function
* Fix bugs parsing algebraic type signatures
* Fix `ClassCastExecption` bug with `Require` olives

RunScanner plugin:

* Fix incorrect splitting when Run Scanner returns an error
  The Run Scanner plugin makes the assumption that if it fails to fetch the
  flowcell geometry, it can return an empty list and downstream processes will
  consider this an error state. The lane splitting grouper however, did not
  reject such records. This change rejects them.
