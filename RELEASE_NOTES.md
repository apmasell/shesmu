    [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration

* Provide an endpoint to count the number of matching actions
* Add a `drain` endpoint (purge and download)
* Prevent paused scripts from running (in addition to stopping their actions)
* Add a new action state for safety interlocks
* Export current and max in flight jobs
* Allow injection constants during simulation
* Add fake refillers to simulator

* Fix `Dump` in join operations to go somewhere

UI changes:

* Include generated tags in histograms and stats tables
* Allow _Drill Down_ in a new tab
* Create a histogram-by-property stats panel
* Handle generating a sequence puzzle challenge for 1 action gracefully

* Fix Pinery IUS demo data to match the current `pinery_ius` schema
* Copy `cerberus_fp` gangs to `pinery_ius`
* Fix bug preventing importing `.niassawf` files in simulation

SFTP/SSH plugin changes:

* Add SSH connection pooling

# [1.5.0] - 2020-11-18T16:09+00:00

Changes:

* Fix incorrect tag regular expression search; regular expression searching on
  tags was missing results.

Language Changes:

* Add `IfDefined` syntax; This is a new feature meant to operate with coming
  new features in the simulation dashboard to permit conditional compilation.

UI Changes:

* Show the base search on the actions page
* Fix sequence generator for dangerous commands to have no duplicates
* Fix pager bug where page doesn't advance fully

TSV/Config Changes:

* Export bad records from structured config files (`.jsonconfig`) via
  Prometheus (`shesmu_structured_config_bad_entry`)

# [1.4.7] - 2020-11-04T19:16+00:00

Language changes:

* Add expression to extract capture groups from a regular expression
	This adds an expression to pull capture groups as a tuple if a regular
	expression matches. This does them positionally, because Java does not
  provide an API to get information about named capture groups.
* Add functions to create dates from numbers

UI Changes:

* Pretty print downloaded JSON files

Pinery Plugin Changes:

* Add `run_id` to `pinery_ius`

# [1.4.6] - 2020-10-30T10:37+00:00

Changes:

* Add tag regex action filter to Swagger
* Fix regex tag matching in query pretty printer (fixes advanced search)

UI Changes:

* Change popup menu calculation again

# [1.4.5] - 2020-10-29T11:22+00:00

Changes:

* Add a new regular expression filter for action tags
* Fix cast class error with join temporary

UI Changes:

* Display parse errors for advanced search
* Improve advanced search UI feedback
	This changes the advanced search input box to provide a visual indicator of
	the query's status and some indication that _Enter_ should be pressed to
  update.
* Fix popup menu positioning again
* Fix display of time ranges in basic search
* Fix formatting of stats ranges
* Fix month selector for time ranges
* Refresh searches from server on _Actions_ page
	The searches provided by the server are populated at page load time. Since
	searches can be updated based on changes in JIRA, this changes the _Actions_
  page to reload the searches every 15 minutes.
* Add a button to download SVG diagrams (on both the _Olives_ page and the simulator)
* Move counts down in metro diagrams
  The counts in the metro diagrams are the number of output records and this can
  be difficult to recognise. This shifts all the counts down by a half row so
  that the count is between the clause that produced and the clause that consumed
  it.
 
Simulator Changes:

* Improve extra definitions buttons (make the styling consistent and add a download button)
* Improve type parsing and WDL outputs (this allows `wdl_outputs) to be imported correctly)
* Allow sharing a script from the simulation console

Niassa Plugin Changes:

* Pull more job status information from Cromwell (failure information mostly)

SFTP Plugin Changes:

* Improve the SFTP refiller
  This makes a few improvements to the SFTP refiller:
  
  - perform reading stdout and stderr and writing to stdin in separate threads to
    avoid buffering
  - when reading the first line from the child, it checks that it is `OK` or
    `UPDATING` and complain about it
  - kill processes that don't respond appropriately

# [1.4.4] - 2020-10-19T10:44+00:00

Changes:

* Alerts from `Reject` or `Require` clauses now report the line number of the olive rather than the clause.
* Data flow counts for `Export Define` olives are reported better in  Prometheus.
* Clear counts for `.actnow` files when deleted

Language changes:

* Improve type safety of algebraic types comparisons

UI changes:

* Create a new definitions dashboard

* Add groups to _Add Filter_ dialog for actions and alerts
* Put buttons and menus of commands in alphabetical order

* Fixes a bug where deleting entries did not save in _Extra Definitions_ in the
  simulator and the saved searches on the _Actions_ page.
* Fix bug where repeat count was negative (on browser console)
* Fix table menu used on the _Olives_ page causing it to look like it should be
  filtered even though it isn't.
* Improve combination locks for dangerous commands
* Synchronize settings across tabs
* Fix a problem where pop up menus will appear in strange locations on the
  page.
* In advanced search, this attempts to refresh the contents as you type, which
  overwhelms the backend causing the front end to behave poorly. This waits
  until enter is pressed.
* Add missing icons to _Bulk Commands_ menu


Niassa+Pinery plugin:

* Use an algebraic type for `pinery::...::platform_for_instrument_model`

Changes:

* Create a `std::string::truncate` function
* Fix bugs parsing algebraic type signatures
* Fix `ClassCastExecption` bug with `Require` olives

  incorrectly disregarded.

RunScanner plugin:

* Fix incorrect splitting when Run Scanner returns an error
  The Run Scanner plugin makes the assumption that if it fails to fetch the
  flowcell geometry, it can return an empty list and downstream processes will
  consider this an error state. The lane splitting grouper however, did not
  reject such records. This change rejects them.
