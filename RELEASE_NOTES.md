# Unreleased

# [1.1.0] - 2020-07-23T17:32+00:00

UI:
* Fix bug with advanced search
  The not-equals/in flag from the queries in the advanced search was being
  incorrectly disregarded.
* Fix event listener on advanced searches
* Fix bug where hidden histograms aren't rendered
* Fix filter type in crosstab cells
* Upgrade to advanced search when basic won't do
* Fix popup menu calculations

Niassa/Pinery plugin:
* Expose Pinery provider in `pinery_project` source
* Fix HALP state for fixable actions
  Actions that are fixable (updatable by signatures) should transition to the
  match's state rather than HALP.
* Fix comparison when getting workflow SWID for logging

RunScanner plugin:

* Fix incorrect splitting when Run Scanner returns an error
  The Run Scanner plugin makes the assumption that if it fails to fetch the
  flowcell geometry, it can return an empty list and downstream processes will
  consider this an error state. The lane splitting grouper however, did not
  reject such records. This change rejects them.
